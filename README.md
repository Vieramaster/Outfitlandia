# Outfitlandia

An app designed to solve what many of us struggle with when getting dressed: combining clothes based on a favorite garment. It also guides you when buying clothes if youâ€™re not exactly sure what you need

## Lessons Learned

This was my first React project. Despite the challenges I faced, I believe I gained a solid foundation. I learned to use hooks correctly and created custom hooks to achieve cleaner and more readable code. Additionally, I handled library installations and usage, such as with Tanstack Query. I also implemented AI requests to generate images of clothing items.
